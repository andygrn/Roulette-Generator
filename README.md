# Roulette Generator

Another little geometric toy to generate some cool shapes. It uses the same principles as that old favourite, Spirograph.

## Options

A **Hypotrochoid** is a little cog running inside a bigger cog. An **Epitrochoid** is a little cog running outside a bigger cog.

**Sharpness** is pretty straightforward. You'll probably want to keep it above 60, but you can get cool effects with very low values.

**Inner Radius** is the radius of the big cog.

**Outer Radius** is the radius of the little cog.

**Distance** is the distance from the center of the little cog to the 'pen'. Unlike real Spirograph, it can be more than the radius of the little cog.
